# Lorenz Attractor
The Lorenz Attractor is a mathematical model that exhibits chaotic behavior, named after the American mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz. It is a set of three ordinary differential equations that describe the motion of a particle in a three-dimensional space.

It's a three-dimensional system of equations that describes the motion of a particle in a chaotic system. 
The equations are:
```:
dx/dt = σ(y - x)
dy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y
dz/dt = xy - βz
```
σ, ρ, and β are parameters that control the behavior of the system. For certain values of these parameters, the system exhibits chaotic behavior, meaning that small changes in the initial conditions result in vastly different trajectories over time.
